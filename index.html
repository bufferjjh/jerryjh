            <h1>About Me</h1>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspProgramming has been a passion of mine for a long time. With the endless amount of free-time I had during lockdown, I found myself immersed in what seemed like a whole new superpower. Over time, I delved deeper into computer science, exposing myself to deeper and more complex concepts.
            I came from printing "Hello World" to using machine learning in my programs, and my learning journey is still ongoing. I want to share what I've learned with the community (for free). Here are some of my proudest accomplishments over the years... 
            <p>▷ I took both AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science Principles in my freshman year. (5s on both)</p>
            <p>▷ Earned a <a style="color: #FFD700; background-color:black; padding: 3px; border-radius: 6px;">perfect score</a> on the AP Computer Science Principles Exam. (Achieved by only 335 out of 116000+ test takers worldwide ~ 0.29%)</p>
            <p>▷ <a href="https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/21-MD07/">Congressional App Challenge </a> Winner (MD-07 ~ Rep. Kweisi Mfume)</p>
            <p>▷ USA Computing Olympiad Silver Division (currently working on advancing to Gold)</p>
            <p>▷ First Place at QuHacks 2021 (Utilized the Discord API to build a bot that reminds users to drink water)</p>
            <p>▷ One of three officers in my school's Computer Science Club (150+ members)</p>

                <h1>Teaching</h1>
                This summer, I want to share what I've learned with the community as teaching is quite new for me. <a style="background-color: greenyellow;">I'm offering one-on-one virtual sessions free of cost for the time being.</a> I can teach basic Python and Java as well as basic programming techniques like complete search or dfs/bfs.
                My teaching experience is limited since I'm still a high school student, but it is a nice little step outside of my comfort zone. I look forward to seeing you guys! Feel free to schedule a session down below or by sending an email with your preferred time!
